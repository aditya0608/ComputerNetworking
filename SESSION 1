Take a wire and connect everyone to this Eg: If A needs to send to B A puts into the wire 
It should be bidirectional ->Equivalent to large table where everyone puts their objects/data.

ADVANTAGES
Adding devices is easier
If individual devices fail connection is not interrupted
Cheap

DISADVANTAGE
Data security as data can be accesible by all
SPOF if cable collapses
High cable traffic /Bandwidth limitations

#2 RING TOPOLOGY

Unidirectional works here but it is not preferable.
Interconnected devices in a ring 
A token is issued to the node sharing the resource not all devices transmit data all at once 

ADVANTAGES

Cheap
Congestion is not purely dependant on number of nodes as adding nodes will also lead to addition of wires

DISADVANTAGES

One node fails evrything fails,same with the cable failure 
Data security at risk as data will have to travel in a circle 
Extension id difficult

#3 START TOPOLOGY

Create a hub and connet everything to this hub
Hub is a smart device can manage connections
If nodes increase increase the number of hubs and connect the hubs together

ADVANTAGES

If a network node fails it's tolerable
Easy to extend
Secure as nodes cannot track data of another devices

DISADVANTAGES

SPOF is the hub
Expensive because of the hub

#4 MESH TOPOLOGY

Connect evrything to evrything
Intuituive equivalent is whatsapp

ADVANTAGES

Easy to detect failures between nodes as they are connected one on one and not dependant on other nodes
Fault tolerant
Security
Fast

DISADVANTAGES

Expensive because of large wires
